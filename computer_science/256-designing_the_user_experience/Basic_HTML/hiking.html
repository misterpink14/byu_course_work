	<b>The Experience</b>
	<br />
</p>
<p>Hiking is a fairly intense adventure walk, usually with the goal of reaching a beatiful view of some sort. Often there are steep uphill and downhill spells while hiking.</p>
<p>Hiking is about seeing parts of nature that you wouldn't normally be able to see. Hiking is rigorous, but work the effort.</p>
