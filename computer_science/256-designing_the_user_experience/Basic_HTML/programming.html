	<br />
</p>
<p>Outdoor programming is enjoying the outdoors while working on a development project.</p>
<p>The outdoors can be inspirational for developers. Theres something about the beauty of nature that gets your creative juices going. Sometimes the fresh air is what you need. Often, you may just need a place to be on your own. Natural light is just a bonus.</p>
