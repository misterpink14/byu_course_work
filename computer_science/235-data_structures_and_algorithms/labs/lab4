Read in a student file, sort students, print out compares

OUTLINE
	Load students into a vector
		copy 1/4 to v2
		sort v2
		print # of compares
		then repeat with half (use origional order)
		then all students
		each time print the caompare
		Do with 4 different sorts
		Every time you call < operator increment compare counter // make it static int compareCount <--makes the variable usable for all students
													// also delare outside the student class int Student::compareCount;
	Measure searches
		load students to vector
		Load query to vector
			copy 1/2 to v2
			copy 1/2 q to q2
			foreach()
				find()
					Student(Q^(ID),"","","") // find this in the student vector
						linear search
						find()
						set.find()
				compareCount/#of queries = int
				
	Write a Report
