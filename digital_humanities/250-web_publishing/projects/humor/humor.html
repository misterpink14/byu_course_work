			<h2>Humor to me</h2>
			<p>To me, humor is more than just laughter. Humor offers a release from stress. Humor keeps my optomistic about what is coming up next. Instead of focusing on the next difficult task before me, I can brush it off while joking around with my wife or friends. Then, when I have to get something time, I am less stressed. This is because I haven't been spending my time focused on it or worried about it, I just handle it when it comes up.</p>

			<q>A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.</q>
