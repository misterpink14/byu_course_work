				Web development is a perfect example of "Digital Humanities." Developing a website is all about attracting as much of your intended audience as possible. Web developers often have to choose the color schema for the website that they are developing. Following best practices, they choose color combinations that appeal to their general audience. They also can be responsible for font choice and general design. The content on a website has to be written such that it affects people. When it comes to increasing a site's web traffic, the humanities are even more important. SEO (search engine optimization) forces a web developer to understand the habits of those who they would like to visit their website. Often, a Web Designer acts as a buffer for creating the design of a website; but, in the end, the developer is responsible for implementation.

				Data mining is a seemingly essential tool for research within the digital humanities. Data mining serves many different purposes. The information gained from collecting data over the internet is essential in gaining accurate and informational data. With this technology, back end developers can create data sets that are useful for a number of different applications. Front end developers can then visualize the data in order to display it in a useful way. These data sets can give a large amount of, often, detailed information. The information can then be used for academic research, predictive analyics, bioinformatics research, language translation, data visualization, actuarial science, etc. Often, data mining and web development converge. Often, there are analysts who are responsible for reading and interpreting the visualized data. In some cases, a web developer will have the responsibilities listed above, as well at those listed here.

			<p class="min-height">
				The purpose of digital publishing is to distribute information through electronic books, digital magazines, digital libraries, etc. This is often accessed while on a device that is connected to the internet. As such, technical writers and publishers work directly with web developers to publish their content. Technical writers are often in charge of writing the content of a digital publication. They play an important role in digital technology. Technical writers have the expertise to write captivating and powerful text that appeals to their intended audience. They take time to understand those who will be using the website. Then, they take time to learn how to tailor their message to the right people. Through digital publishing, we can discover new trends and get a feel for what people dislike. This gives a technical writer the information they need publish helpful material.
