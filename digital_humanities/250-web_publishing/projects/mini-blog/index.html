		<h1>What is the "Digital Humanities"?</h1>
		<div class="padding">
			<p>
				The "Digital Humanities" (or DH) discipline can easily be broken down into two main academic areas: Technology and the Humanities. This discipline studies the value of technology used to improve research in the humanities.

		<h1>What is Technology?</h1>
		<div class="padding">
			<p>
				The <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology">Merriam-Webster</a> dictionary has two simple definitions of technology. The first one is as follows: <br /><br />
				<q>the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems</q><br /><br />
				This is pretty straightforward. Technology is the applied use of inventions and science in the workplace.<br/>The next definition is as follows:<br /><br />
				<q>a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology</q><br /><br />
				Technology is also the result of using science and inventions to create tangible tools that are used in the workplace.

		<h1>What is the Humanities?</h1>
		<div class="padding">
			<p>
				The humanities contains a huge collection of studies. But, ut simply, <a href="http://shc.stanford.edu/what-are-the-humanities">Stanford</a> defines the humanities as:<br/><br/>
				<q>the study of how people process and document the human experience</q><br/><br/>
				This includes <q>philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language</q>.
			</p>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<div class="padding">
			<p>
				"Digital Humanities" takes a hands on approach to technologies and tools that are used in the workplace. These technologies can be applied to all areas of the Humanities. To me, "Digital Humanities" has to do with the appliction of technologies to the design, content, and style of what we as humans use, with a focus on computing.
