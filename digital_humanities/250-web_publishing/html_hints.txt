do this:


use float
use clear
use media queries
	- breakpoints
		- not referencing ballpark screen size for phone
		- building responsiveness for a site
		- mobile first
			- my base styles look great on mobile phone
			- then add media query when things get too big
			- easier to approach because it is additive
			- Meta tag: 
				<meta name="viewpoint" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

				@media screen and (min-device-width:400px) // he did 480px and 660px
